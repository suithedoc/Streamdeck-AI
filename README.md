# Streamdeck-AI

Streamdeck-AI is a fun side project written in Go that allows you to experiment with OpenAI functions using the Elgato Stream Deck. Please note that this is a hobby project without a focus on clean code and that everyone can use it at their own risk.

## Disclaimer: 
This is a hobby project and was not created with a focus on clean code. Use it at your own risk.

## Dependencies

To use this project, you need the following:

- Elgato Stream Deck
- OpenAI ApiKey
- Discord ApiKey (optional)

## Features
Streamdeck-AI has the following features:

- Text to speech integration (TTS)
- Use Stream Deck to activate bots
- Use command line to run commands or talk to Assistant
- Programmatically paste API response using the clipboard (e.g. into Minecraft console, Discord, etc.)
- Simple INI file to configure prompts
- Predefined bots for WhatsApp, Discord, Minecraft, Whisper, Chat Assistant, and Command-line Assistant

## Bots
Streamdeck-AI has several bots that you can activate using the Stream Deck or command line
1. Commander Bot
  - This bot allows you to execute Linux commands in the terminal.
  - Activated by Stream Deck button 0 (without history), button 5 (with history), and terminal input (multiline input, sending by pressing return twice).
  - Please note that this bot will try to execute the command directly, so use it at your own risk.
2. Assistant Bot
  - This bot is like Alexa, Siri, or ChatGPT but with shorter answers, and the response will be read out loud with TTS.
  - Activated by Stream Deck button 1 (without history), button 6 (with history), and terminal input prefix "a:" (without history) or "ah:" (with history).
3. Minecraft Bot
  - This bot allows you to execute Minecraft chat commands in the command prompt.
  - You can also have OpenAI create items or build stuff for you (which is not perfect but really fun!).
  - Activated by Stream Deck button 3.
  - Works by programmatically copying the response of OpenAI (GTP3.5/4) to the clipboard and pasting it to the Minecraft console.
4. Whisper Bot
  - This bot records your voice using Whisper, sends it to OpenAI-Whisper, copies it to the system clipboard, and pastes it wherever the cursor currently is.
  - Activated by Stream Deck button 2.
5. WhatsApp Bot
  - This bot allows OpenAI to answer WhatsApp messages.
  - Currently, one number and one name are configurable in the config.ini file.
6. Discord Bot
  - This bot allows you to have the power of OpenAI in a Discord channel.
7. Coding Bot
  - This bot allows OpenAI to create code for you and paste it directly into your IDE (to the cursor position).
  - Activated by Stream Deck button 4.

## Tips when having problems with the Stream Deck (tested on Manjaro Linux)
* create a udev rule:
  * `sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-streamdeck.rules`
* add following text into the .rules file
  * `SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="vendor_id", ATTRS{idProduct}=="product_id", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"`
* reboot
